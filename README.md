This repository will serve as the hub for our machine learning projects to incorporate with the other projects we do.

Current plans revolve around setting up xavier assistant, where we will skill build to provide support to the other projects, to include:

- Voice activated network status reports from the network monitor
- Voice control of PiRouter configuration
- Alerts from network monitor and PiRouter for various events
